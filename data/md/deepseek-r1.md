# DeepSeek R1 + In-Depth Research + New Features of Ollama



Download Ollama Deep Researcher and set up R1 on your device.  
Then, give R1 a topic and watch as it searches the web, learns, reflects, and searches further.  
It will automatically repeat this process for as long as you want it to research.  
In the end, it provides a thorough report with all the sources it consulted.  

Both the project and the model are fully open-source.

It runs smoothly on an M1 Mac.

Really looking forward to the performance improvements of the 7B or 8B version of R1.  
Then connect it to something like a deep-research-enabled cursor.  
Let it write code and fix bugs on its own while I sleep.  
Isn't this basically a free Devin?
