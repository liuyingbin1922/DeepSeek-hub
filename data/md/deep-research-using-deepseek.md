# Deep Research using DeepSeek

I find a open source implementation of OpenAI's new Deep Research agent. Get the same capability without paying $200.

You can even tweak the behavior of the agent with adjustable breadth and depth.

Run it for 5 min or 5 hours, it'll auto adjust.

Internally, the agent will take the user input, break it down into different sub research threads that it'll run in parallel, and recursively iterate based on new learnings, spawns new research threads, and collect new knowledge until it reaches the necessary breadth and depth.

It's a pretty simple architecture, but o3 doesn't need much guardrails. Just give it the right tools, and let it follow its curiosity.
